    <h2 class="mt-5">ACCURACY OF BMI MEASUREMENTS</h2>
    <p>
      There are some great benefits to the BMI formula. It takes natural
      variations in peoplesâ€™ body shapes into account, allowing a healthy weight
      range according to their height. In giving an absolute reading that can be
      applied across the board in this way, BMI measurements supply very useful
      data from which healthcare and fitness professionals can take their cues.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said, there are several other factors that need to be taken
      into account when deciding how overweight individuals actually are. For
      many people, a BMI reading may not prove an accurate testament to their
      body fat levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muscle is far denser than fat. As a result, very muscular people, such as
      bodybuilders and certain athletes, may have healthy body fat levels even
      though they would be classed as obese by their BMI measurements. This is
      because they will have extra weight in the form of muscle.

    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-5">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BMI IN YOUR FITNESS JOURNEY</h2>
    <h4 class="mb-3">1. MONITORING YOUR PROGRESS</h4>
    <p>
      Whether you're embarking on a weight loss journey, aiming to gain muscle
      mass, or simply maintaining your current weight, BMI can help you track
      your progress over time. Regularly calculating your BMI allows you to see
      how your efforts are paying off and make necessary adjustments to your
      fitness and nutrition plan.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mb-3">2. SETTING REALISTIC GOALS</h4>

      routine. GymGenius offers a wide range of fitness programs and expert
      guidance to assist you in achieving your goals
    </p>
    <h4 class="mb-3">3. HEALTH ASSESSMENT</h4>
    <p>
      BMI is not just about aesthetics; it's also about health. Research has
      shown that individuals with a BMI within the normal range are generally at
      a lower risk of various health issues, such as heart disease, diabetes,
      and obesity-related complications. Maintaining a healthy BMI is crucial
      for overall well-being.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-5">LIMITATIONS OF BMI:</h2>
    <h4 class="mb-3">1- DOESN'T CONSIDER BODY COMPOSITION:</h4>
    <p>
      BMI does not take into account an individual's body composition, such as
      muscle mass and body fat percentage. This means that someone with a high
      muscle mass may have a higher BMI, even if they are not overweight or
      obese.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mb-3">2- DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR AGE OR GENDER:</h4>
    <p>
      BMI does not consider age or gender, which can be important factors in
      assessing health. For example, older adults may have a higher BMI due to
      age-related changes in muscle and fat distribution.
    </p>
    <h4 class="mb-3">3- LACKS PRECISION:</h4>
    <p>
      BMI provides a single number, which may not accurately reflect an
      individual's health. It doesn't distinguish between different types of fat
      (visceral vs. subcutaneous), which have different health implications.
